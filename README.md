    ...
    $ cd cortex/
    ```

    ```

## Usage

The `cortex` package provides the following classes:

- `Thought`

   A class that encapsulates the thought object

    ```pycon
    >>> t1 = Thought(1, datetime.datetime.now(), 'General Kenobi!')
    >>> t1.user_id
    1
    >>> t1.timestamp
    datetime.datetime(2019, 12, 15, 12, 19, 38, 341471)
    >>> t1.thought
    'General Kenobi!'

    ```



The `cortex` package also provides a command-line interface:

```sh
$ python -m cortex
```


The CLI provides the `upload-thought`, `serve` and `serve-web` subcommands

`upload-thought <Address> <User ID> <Thought>`: Uploads a given `Thought` with the ID of
the user given by `User ID` to the server on `Address`

`serve <Address> <Data Dir>`: Starts a server on `Address` that stores thoughts uploaded
to it in `Data Dir`

`serve-web <Address> <Data Dir> [-d\--debug]`: Starts a server that serves a web interface
for the system on `Address`, reads data from `Data Dir`. Use `-d` 
or `--debug` to enable debugging on the server

```sh
$ python -m cortex upload-thought 0.0.0.0:3000 1 "Hello there"
Uploading to 0.0.0.0:3000 a thought by user 1

$ python -m cortex serve 0.0.0.0:3000 "./tmp"
Starting a server on 0.0.0.0:3000 which stores data in ./tmp


$ python -m cortex serve-web 0.0.0.0:3000 "./tmp" -d
